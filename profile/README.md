# Welcome to SuiPad
![Sui Pad Platform](https://github.com/suipad-app/.github/raw/main/assets/suipad-01.png)

SuiPad is the first decentralised fair-launchpad on the Sui network that helps the creative ideals to become the real applications in life. 

SuiPad is currently focusing on fundraising for web3 projects such as NFT, Gaming, Digital asset management, Defi, SocialFi … but not limited to any projects that help the transition from web2 to web3.

## How SuiPad work
SuiPad allows project owners to list their project on the platform to raise the funds from the early phase and also allow users to access the project as the early investors. 

Unlike traditional crowdfunding platforms, SuiPad is the decentralised platform where all of the project will be funded with the crypto currency (coin or token). It will help everyone to access the platform easily from everywhere with any amount of money (coin/token) and the fee is nearly zero. 

## The Key Features
### Project registration 
Everyone can submit their projects to raise funds in terms of IDO, early sale token on SuiPad. The projects need to be reviewed and some of the criteria must me meet 
- What’s the problem that the project try solving 
- How project solve the problem 
- The funds raising target and plan to use the funds
- The refund condition and warranty 
- Project team experience and expertise  
- Detailed project information such as website, whitepaper, source code (If it is open source), media channels … 
  
### The KYC process
SuiPad follow the KYC/AML regulation, so that project owner and investors may need to pass the KYC procedure before listing or participating on the token sales

### Fair access to early token sales
SuiPad has a fair mechanism for any users on the platform to access the project token sales. The mechanism will be based on ticket system and the the supporter who bring values to the project in the long-term vision 

### Earning mechanism 
SuiPad has the earning mechanism so that everyone can start earning by staking the platform token, adding liquidity or farming (the next phase). Users can also receive the bonus/airdrop token in some marketing campaign, please follow us and stay-tuned for more information.

### On-chain referential mechanism 
SuiPad is the first launchpad platform on the Sui network that applies the on-chain referential mechanism. The on-chain ref mechanism allows users to refer for a friend to join the SuiPad and get the commission automatically and transparently managed by smart contracts.

### Platform government 
SuiPad is the community-driven platform for fundraising. Communities can raise their voice by creating the proposal or voting for the proposal. It’s the community to decide what the platform should be like.

### Other features 
Many functions will be integrated to the platform based on the community's opinions. SuiPad will be the best ecosystem not only for fundraising but also for managing the digital access, the investment portfolio, the earning and social activity place.

### Token utility 
With SPT, users can:
- Stake to get the tickets to buy the token sales
- Platform government: vote for listing projects or proposals
- Earn interesting rate from staking pools 
- Swap/exchange with other coin/token 

## How to participate in token sales
Most of the early project token sales have an attractive price (normally the price will increase 2-3x in the next rounds) and the project owners mostly raise a small funds in this IDO early token sales. Each project will have the rule to restrict users from participating in the token sales, they want users who buy the token at a good price will help them to spread the projects in the long-term vision. 

SuiPad follows the rules of the project and creates a fair opportunity for everyone in the platform. That’s why We need to whitelist the buyers and design the ticket mechanism. Only users with their ticket in their wallet can buy the early token sales. The following steps guide users to buy the IDO token: 
- Register member with one of the favourite Sui wallet extension
- Complete the KYC process (if required) 
- Get the tickets before the project is opened to sales
- Prepare the funds (SUI token or stable coin in Sui network) to buy the IDO

### How to get the tickets
There are many ways to get the tickets from SuiPad, users can either support the projects or stake the SPT token in the staking pool.
- Support for projects: The number of tickets and the way to get the tickets will depend on the real situation and notify all users at the time the project is launched. Generally, users help to bring the project to community by their activities such as reviewing the project, sharing or retweeting the post, recommend to their friends … be considered as the early supporter and get the ticket to buy the IDO token.

- Get ticket by stake SPT token: Staking the SPT token is the popular way to get the tickets. The number of ticket that users may get will be described in buy the formula below: 
```ticket = Math.floor(SPT/1000) + bonus``` and ```bonus = Math.floor(SPT/5000)```
That means users get 1 ticket for each 1000 SPT staking token and get another 1 ticket for each other 5000 SPT staking token. For example :
    - If user stake 3000 SPT, they get floor(3000/1000) = 3 tickets
    - If user stake 8000 SPT, they get floor(8000/1000) + floor(8000/5000) = 10 tickets 
    - If users stake 65.000 SPT, they get floor(65000/1000) + floor(65000/5000) = 65 + 13 = 78 tickets

### How to buy the IDO token
Users must have tickets and have enough funds in their wallet to participate in the IDO. 
The tickets will be transparently accumulated from smart contracts and the token that users are allowed to buy is calculated by the formula below: 

```token = user_ticket*total_token_sale/tottal_ticket```

Where:
- The ```token``` is the IDO token that users are allowed to buy. 
- The ```user_ticket``` is the number of tickets that users collect before the token sale
- The ```total_token``` is the total token in the IDO round
- The ```toal_ticket``` is the sum up of all tickets from all users participate in the token sales

Please note that the number of ```token```  must be in the range [Min, Max] and the vesting schedule will follow the project’s policies.

## Be the Suipad OG
SuiPad is in the very early stage and needs the help from the community. The Old Generation (OG) is someone who joins us early and supports us will have many opportunities to get the tickets and buy the project sale token. 

There are several  ways to be our platform OGs such as follow and retweet our posts on twitter, write blog posts or mention us on social networks, join the testnet apps … 

The organisations/partners that help us in technology and business stuff are also considered as the OGs and have privileged access to the platforms.
